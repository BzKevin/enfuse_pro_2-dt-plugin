The version hosted here on GitHub is my modified version. The modifications and improvements are primarily for cross-platform compatibility. A few features have been added as well:
-Apply style on auto-import
-Copy dt tags on auto-import (from first source image)
-add new tags on auto-import
-fixed "on conflict create unique name" behavior to function properly
-bypass output file path chooser via "import at source image location" option

Loss of functionality compared to original version:
  -Language translations
  -Reset button has no effect
